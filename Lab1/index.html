    <strong>Fairy</strong><br>
    <em>
        Either I mistake your shape and making quite,<br>
        Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite<br>
        Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he<br>
        That frights the maidens of the villagery;<br>
        Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern<br>
        And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;<br>
        And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;<br>
        Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?<br>
        Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,<br>
        You do their work, and they shall have good luck:<br>
        Are not you he?</em>
    </br>
    <strong>PUCK</strong><br>
    <em>
        The king doth keep his revels here to-night:<br>
        Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<br>
        For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br>
        Because that she as her attendant hath<br>
        A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;<br>
        She never had so sweet a changeling;<br>
        And jealous Oberon would have the child<br>
        Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;<br>
        But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<br>
        Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:<br>
        And now they never meet in grove or green,<br>
        By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br>
        But, they do square, that all their elves for fear<br>
        Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
